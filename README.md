# Board Game App
This app will help the user find board games they like in one of two ways. One way is by plugging in your game preferences, such as playing time and game category, and it will show the top five games. The other way is by randomly showing games and you can choose "Like" or "Dislike." All games that are "Liked" will be saved in a different tab. Once the app is fully functional, the act of liking/disliking a game will have an effect on the future games shown (the app will use gradient descent on a couple of variables to find games you enjoy most).\
\
Future Updates: 
- Get theta values to change properly using gradient descent, which will allow us to recommend games based on their preferences. \ 
- Find a way to scrape images off of the internet to show with each game (xpaths are not working on BoardGameGeek)

Note: I had to remove a lot of the data (selecting only the necessary columns and taking away those that were not owned by more than a certain amount of people) to make it fit into a usable dataset.
